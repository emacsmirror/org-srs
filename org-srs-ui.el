(require 'custom)

(require 'org-srs-property)

(defgroup org-srs-ui nil
  "User interfaces for Org-srs."
  :group 'org-srs
  :prefix "org-srs-ui-")

;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode org-srs-ui-mode
  "Minor mode to enable all Org-srs user interfaces."
  :group 'org-srs-ui
  :global t
  (cl-loop with arg = (if org-srs-ui-mode +1 -1)
           for member in (org-srs-property-group-members 'org-srs-ui #'org-srs-property-minor-mode-p)
           unless (eq member 'org-srs-ui-mode)
           when (org-srs-property-minor-mode-p member)
           do (cl-assert (fboundp member)) (cl-assert (boundp member))
